1. Added new commands and functions to make the plugin development more friendly.
2. A new console command was added (localload).
      - It can be used to load a dll file (DBEvent, DBCommand or DBSlashCommand) from the specified file (from ./Data/Plugins)
      - Example: localload Leveling System
          => this will load file ./Data/Plugins/Leveling System.dll to the bot
      - This function is now called right after a plugin was downloaded (no need for restart)
