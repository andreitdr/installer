Overall:

    Stability increased for linux based systems.
    Fixed some bugs on startup

Plugin Manager:

    removed bot specific methods and functions from the API
    changed how console actions work
    the bots created with this API can now respond to mentions
    rebuild the logger from scratch
    reworked config
    removed plugin updater as component on the API. This should be handled by the application, not the API
    reworked how the URLs work. A file should now be generated in the Resources folder (URLs.json) that contain all required URLs for the bot to run. This of course can be modified to suit your needs.
    renamed CmdArgs to DBCommandExecutingArguments
    improved documentation
    moved some functions to other namespaces to make it more clear
    created Spinner class as another method to display a loading progress
    moved ConsoleUtilities to the bot as it does not help the API in any way.
    started working on an API that can be used for Windows Desktop applications too (so it does no need anything related to Console in its core components).
    the config is now using JSON strings instead of local SQL database. The database is still available tho for plugins.

The bot executable:

    improved logging. Everything is now logged.
    console commands have now a better output.
    removed progress bar as it was buggy on linux systems
    changed to spinner as the main "loading" progress system
    downloading plugins or listing plugins now shows the location where the download system will put the file; it will display the url from where the download will occur
    a new setup script was created to implement the URLs thing. Can be found in Installer.cs
    removed startup arguments from the bot
